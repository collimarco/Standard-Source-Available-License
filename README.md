## Limits of open source licenses

Open source has great advantages, but, often, it is also a way for big corporations to exploit the work of independent developers.

This has produced a negative impact on the ecosystem, including:

- frustration of maintainers and sabotages (e.g. Faker)
- security vulnerabilities (e.g. Log4j, Heartbleed)
- widely-used software that is not well-maintained.

## A "standard" source available license

I propose a license that has the following qualities:

- Simple
- Inspired by permissive licenses
- Source available
- Makes monetization possible (e.g. for advanced features or for usage above certain thresholds)

There are already many projects (e.g. Redis modules, Gitlab EE) that use "Source Available" licenses,
but their licenses are complex and non-standard and that may limit the adoption of such projects (this is even more true for smaller projects).

Having a "Standard Source Available License" makes it easy for developers to use a "Source Available" license for their project.

It will also make it easier to use and modify a "Source Available" project, without worries about a strange clause somewhere.

A wide adoption of this license will make it legally required for larger organizations to buy a license and sponsor the project, with the result of happier contributors and well-maintained software.

## Usage

Feel free to use this license for your next project, open a discussion or suggest improvements... 

If you like the idea, give it a star and spread the voice (e.g. blog post, Twitter).
